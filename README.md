# EmployeeManagment
Implementation of an Employee Management System in C++. This program allows you to perform various operations on a list of employee records, including building the employee table, inserting new entries, deleting entries, and searching for records based on employee ID. 
The program starts with the definition of the employee structure, which holds information about an employee, such as name, employee ID, position, experience, age, and salary.
When the program starts, it displays the main menu and waits for the user to input an option. Depending on the chosen option, it calls the corresponding function to perform the desired operation. After each operation, the main menu is displayed again, and the user can continue performing operations or exit the program.
